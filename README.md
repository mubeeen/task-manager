# **Task Manager with Real-Time Collaboration**

## **Project Overview**
The **Task Manager** is a dynamic and responsive web application designed for managing tasks effectively. It supports real-time collaboration across browser tabs and offers offline functionality via browser's local storage. This project demonstrates expertise in front-end development using modern tools and practices.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **Task Management**:
   - Create, update, and delete tasks.
   - Categorize tasks by status: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
   - Assign tasks to specific team members.

2. **Real-Time Collaboration**:
   - Changes made to tasks are reflected across all open browser tabs.

3. **Offline Support**:
   - Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence even when offline.

4. **User Experience**:
   - A clean and intuitive user interface designed for productivity.
   - Responsive design for seamless use on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

5. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**:
   - The app is installable on desktops and mobile devices.
   - Accessible offline with support for caching static assets.

---

## **Technical Stack**
### **Frontend**:
- **React with TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and robust code structure.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Efficient state management for managing tasks.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid styling and responsive design.

### **Data Management**:
- **Browser Local Storage**: Persistent storage for tasks and offline data.

### **Progressive Web App (PWA)**:
- Service workers and a manifest file for offline capability.

### **Collaboration Simulation**:
- Browser `StorageEvent` API to synchronize tasks in real time across tabs.

---

## **Project Objectives**
1. Showcase advanced knowledge of **Redux Toolkit** and **React TypeScript**.
2. Demonstrate the ability to implement **real-time collaboration** in single-user applications.
3. Highlight skills in building **offline-first applications** using local storage and PWA technology.
4. Provide a professional, scalable solution for task management.

---

## **Key Implementation Details**
1. **Task State Management**:
   - Tasks are stored in a centralized Redux store.
   - Changes to tasks trigger local storage updates for persistence.

2. **Real-Time Synchronization**:
   - Leveraged the `StorageEvent` API to listen for changes in local storage and update Redux state dynamically.

3. **Offline-First Design**:
   - Integrated a PWA setup to cache static assets and enable offline functionality.
   - Local storage ensures task data remains available without internet connectivity.

4. **Scalable Design**:
   - Modular components for easy scalability and maintainability.
   - State structure designed to accommodate future features like user authentication or cloud synchronization.

---

## **Potential Enhancements**
1. **Multi-Device Collaboration**:
   - Extend the app to support real-time synchronization across devices using cloud-based solutions (e.g., Firebase, Supabase).

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Allow users to log in and access their tasks from any device.

3. **Enhanced Task Features**:
   - Add task reminders, due dates, and priority levels.
   - Integrate file attachments or comments for each task.

4. **Theming**:
   - Enable light/dark mode support for better user experience.
